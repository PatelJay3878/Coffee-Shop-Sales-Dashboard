## Data Insights and Recommendations
### 1) Sales Trends Over Time

The Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard reveals a consistent growth trend in total revenue across all three locations over the observed periods. Each location demonstrates a steady increase in sales performance, particularly as the year progresses towards the warmer months


### 2) Busiest Days of the Week

**Astoria:**

Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday emerge as the most lucrative days for sales in Astoria, outperforming Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday. 

This trend may be attributed to customers choosing to stay at home and enjoy quality time with family during weekends.

**Hell's Kitchen:**

Hell's Kitchen exhibits strong sales performance throughout the week, with the exception of Saturday. 

Situated in the heart of New York, near various tourist attractions, the location thrives during weekdays when offices are open. 

Sundays also contribute significantly to sales, likely influenced by heightened tourist activity. 

Notably, the month of June witnessed an extraordinary achievement, with the location generating an all-time high revenue of approximately "$57,000," surpassing the other two locations.

Despite its prime location as a tourist destination, Lower Manhattan presents an average performance in terms of revenue and sales.

Monday emerges as the busiest day for this location, while Thursday and Friday maintain average sales. On other days, sales remain steady, distinguishing its performance from the other two locations.
